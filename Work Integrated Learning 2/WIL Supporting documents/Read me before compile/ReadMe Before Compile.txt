In order to run the Project Successfully you require the Following steps 
1. Copy The "UserInformation" file and paste it into your C: drive
the path must be like this one 
C:\UserInformation
2. Depending on the PC You Are Using Writing To Database uses different connection strings according to the serverName And Connection string 
so if the project Does not Compile Then You Have to Change all the Connection Strings that write data to The Database 
4. Hopefully It Works :)
